# UnoKeyboard
(ONLY FOR LINUX/X11) Don't have a pro micro or Leonardo ? Here is an easier way to use an Arduino Uno as a keyboard

# Instructions
- Create a push button circuit, and set the input pin as D2
- Execture the python script on a Linux computer, which uses X11, unfortunately, I could not find any way to emulate keyboards on Wayland.
- You may need to configure the port
- Enjoy!
